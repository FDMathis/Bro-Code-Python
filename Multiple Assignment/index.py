# multiple assignment = allows us to assign variables at the same 
#                       time in one line of code

# Single Assignment
name = "Spopngebob"
age = 21
attractive = False

print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

#Multiple Assignment
name, age, attractive = "Patrick", 25, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

#Another example with multiple people
Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

print(Spongebob)
print(Patrick)
print(Sandy)
print(Squidward)
